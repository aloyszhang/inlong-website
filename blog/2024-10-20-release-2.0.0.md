## 2.0.0 Feature Introduction

### New Transform Capabilities
InLong Transform enhances InLong's ability to expand access and distribution capabilities by adapting to a wider range of data protocols and reporting scenarios on the input side,
while accommodating complex and diverse data analysis scenarios on the output side. This improves data quality and collaboration, providing computing capabilities such as connection, 
aggregation, filtering, grouping, value extraction, and sampling, all decoupled from the computation engine.

It simplifies the pre-processing operations for users reporting data, lowers the barriers to data usage, and streamlines the pre-operations required before users can start analyzing data. 
The focus is on the business value of data, achieving the goal of making data "visible and usable."

### OceanBase Data Source
OceanBase Database is a distributed relational database known for its high availability and scalability, making it suitable for large-scale data storage and processing scenarios. 
The InLong 2.0.0 version has added support for the OceanBase data source, allowing data to be imported from various sources into OceanBase.

The management of OceanBase data nodes is similar to that of MySQL:

![2.0.0-oceanbase-detail.png](img/2.0.0-oceanbase-detail.png)

The configuration includes key information such as:
- Node Name
- Type (OceanBase)
- Username
- Password
- Address

Below is an example configuration for writing data to OceanBase:

First, create the data target, selecting the type as: `OceanBase`

![2.0.0-oceanbase-type.png](img/2.0.0-oceanbase-type.png)

Then, fill in the relevant information:

Thank you to @xxsc0529 for their contributions to this feature. For more details, please refer to INLONG-10700, INLONG-10701, and INLONG-10704.

### Dynamic Resource Calculation for Sort Tasks
The total resources (task parallelism) for the Flink Sort Job are derived from the configuration file flink-sort-plugin.properties. 
This means that all submitted sorting jobs will use the same amount of resources. When the data scale is large, resources may be insufficient, while with smaller data scales, resources may be wasted.

Therefore, dynamically calculating the required resource quantity based on data volume is a highly needed feature. 
InLong now supports dynamically calculating the total resources required for tasks based on data volume, involving two core data points:
- Task Data Volume: The data volume relies on the auditing system, derived from the average data volume of `DataProxy` over the past hour as recorded by the auditing system.
- Single-Core Processing Capacity: The processing capacity per core depends on the maximum number of messages configured for a single core in the `flink-sort-plugin.properties` file.

With these two data points, the total resources required for a task can be calculated. This feature supports a toggle, allowing users to enable or disable it as needed.

Thank you to @PeterZh6 for their contributions to this feature. For more details, please refer to INLONG-10916.

### SortStandalone Supports HTTP Sink
Inlong SortStandalone is responsible for consuming data from MQ and distributing it to various data storage systems, supporting multiple storage options such as ElasticSearch and CLS.
Compared to SortFlink, SortStandalone offers higher performance and lower latency, making it suitable for scenarios with stringent performance requirements.

The HTTP protocol is a widely used communication protocol. SortStandalone supports HTTP output, allowing data to be sent to HTTP interfaces without needing to focus on the specific storage implementation, 
thus providing greater flexibility to adapt to different business scenarios.

The processing flow for HTTP output is as follows:

![2.0.0-sortstandalone-http.png](img/2.0.0-sortstandalone-http.png)

HTTP output has the following characteristics:
- SortSDK is responsible for consuming data from MQ.
- Supports semaphore-based flow control capabilities.
- Metadata management relies on Manager, supporting dynamic updates.
- The output protocol is HTTP, decoupling the specific storage implementation.
- Supports retry strategies.

- Thank you to @yfsn666 and @fuweng11 for their contributions to this feature. For more details, please refer to INLONG-10831 and INLONG-10884.
